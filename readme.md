Hi!

I'm a full-stack developer, with a deep love for Go and TypeScript.  
I'm usually the most active on Wednesdays here on Github.  
To find out more about my work, look at [my website](https://www.sewera.dev),  
[my upcoming blog](https://blog.sewera.dev), or my beloved project,
[notipie](https://github.com/blazejsewera/notipie)  
(I even wrote [a thesis](https://github.com/sewera/eng-thesis) about it).

I'm constantly looking for new ways to make software development more efficient.  
As Dave Farley said[^1] and wrote[^2] many times,
I'm trying to "do what works to build better software faster".
